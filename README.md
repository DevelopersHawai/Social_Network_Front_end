## Why this project?:

When I was 19 years old, now 42.  I used to scrub floors and clean bathrooms in public establishments.  I hated the job, and I was discoruraged to go to work daily.

Then my mother advised me to create my own company cleaning and while it made me money I was never really happy.  So I took it amoung myself to sell perfume which failed as my ability to walk up to strangers in the street and beg them to buy perfume was not really going well either.

So in 2000 I joined Strayer University.  I thought it would of done something for me, but I really did not learn much from there.  So I went for my MCSE and although I was good enough to support millions of dollars of equipment.  I was often the first to be let go when a newer or younger generation applied for my job.

After being fired, laid-off, and burned out.  I now have decided that free lance work is what I do, or my salary is $200k and I don't do interviews.

You either pay me, or you bounce, because my time is programming time, and I get paid to program devices, and make sofware.  So I have told myself, this is my last stand.  I sink or I swim.  If I sink, then I inject myself back into the "system" and I allow the machine to control my very existence, or...

This platform will make everyone who works on it money, and returns to you all the time you spent into it, but without financial burdens and stress that the average human being goes through when visiting the lack of money.

I pray that your development skills are improve while you learn on this platform to assist in adding one new feature to this community so that we can endorse you and help you get that new job or start your own company.

I pray to my GOD and I work for myself going forward, after working for a great group of people, and watching for so long.  

I see myself in the future, with a mansion, a few Lamborghinis and a wine collection so we all can celebrate both yours and my wealth as I promise to share if you promise to commit the time.
